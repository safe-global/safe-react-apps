<!--
Remember to create a title following the Conventional Commits guidelines. Examples for valid PR titles are:

fix: Some thing found in the repo
feat: Add some feature
refactor!: Make some refactor
feat(wallet-connect): Add some feature

Note that since PR titles only have a single line, you have to use the ! syntax for breaking changes.

For more examples, take a look at:
